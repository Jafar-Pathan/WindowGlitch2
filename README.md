# WindowGlitch2
second and improved version of WindowGlitch

A script in java to simulate classic window glitch using javafx.

It creates an object of stage each time window is dragged. Resulting a glitch like condition. This is version 1 with no control just simple drag and create glitch.
In this version 2, you can create new stage, set size of stage, close all stages, create stages with random background color.

HOW TO RUN IT :- It is very simple to run this script. on Windows open cmd and goto the source folder. 
Type "javac WindowGlitch2.java" - this will create a class file. Next type "java WindowGlitch2" - this will run the program. To close it, from taskbar close the program or click close button.

NOTE:- this is created and tested on Windows 10 64 bit, jdk-8, javafx-8. if you are on linux or mac and there is compatability issues which you can fix, i'll appreciate it. :->

Happy coding....
